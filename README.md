## Overview

In the era of increasing cyber threats, robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are indispensable for network security. This framework provides a structured approach to design, implement, and evaluate IDS using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Components

### Data Collection

- **Sources**: Network traffic, system logs, application logs, user activities.
- **Tools**: Packet sniffers (e.g., Wireshark), log management systems (e.g., ELK Stack).

### Data Preprocessing

- **Tasks**: Cleaning, normalization, transformation of raw data.
- **Tools**: Data preprocessing libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn in Python).

### Feature Extraction and Selection

- **Techniques**: Statistical methods, domain-specific heuristics, machine learning-based feature selection.
- **Tools**: Feature extraction libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).

### Model Design and Training

- **Algorithms**: CNNs, RNNs, SVMs, etc.
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch for model development and training.

### Detection and Response

- **Mechanisms**: Signature-based detection, anomaly detection, hybrid methods.
- **Tools**: Snort (signature-based IDS), custom-built detection models.

### Evaluation and Testing

- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, false positive rate.
- **Datasets**: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS2017 for benchmarking.

### Deployment and Maintenance

- **Environment**: Cloud-based, on-premises, hybrid setups.
- **Tools**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration.

### Visualization and Reporting

- **Tools**: Grafana, Kibana for real-time monitoring and reporting.
